# nimble-tag-versioned

Hi! This fork of [@yglukhov](https://github.com/yglukhov)'s [nimble-tag repository](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag) extends the original design by Amy Shaw (in [this PR](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag/pull/1)) by adding versioning to the tag.

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amkrajewski/nimble-tag/master/nimble.svg)

You can change it to whatever you desire by opening _raw_ SVG with text editor and replacing `v1.11.11` with your version. Or whatever else you want! You can also replace it with your package name to attach it to some larger project badges.

Manual for now, but I will try to automate it in near future :)
