# nimble-tag-versioned

Hi! This fork of [@yglukhov](https://github.com/yglukhov)'s [nimble-tag repository](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag) extends the original design by Amy Shaw (in [this PR](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag/pull/1)) by adding versioning to the tag.

You can change it to whatever you desire by opening the _raw_ SVG at this repository root with a text editor and replacing the `v1.11.11` with your version. Or whatever else you want! You can also replace it with your package name to attach it to some larger project badges indicating nim was used. Then simply include it in your HTML

Manual deployment for now, but I will try to automate it in near future :)
